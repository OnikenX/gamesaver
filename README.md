# Game Saves

This repository has my saved games for diferent games.
The folders can be hard linked to the folders where my games are so i just have to `git add . && git commit && git push` and everything will be updated.

For now I'm copying the files so I can have a backup to my saves too.

My personal updater is not public but I created a mockup as a exemple of how to do it.
